### The purpose of this self-project is to look at the mortality numbers and leading causes of death among different densely populated states in the US.
From a dataset provided by Data.gov we are going to be using a csv file to analyze the mortality numbers and leading causes of death in 3 states. We will be looking into California, Texas, and Florida.
